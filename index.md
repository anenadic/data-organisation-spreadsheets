Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. Most
researchers have data in spreadsheets, so it is the place that many research
projects start.

We often organise data in spreadsheets in the ways that we as humans want to work with data. However, in order
to use tools that make computation and data analysis more efficient, reusable and reproducible, such as programming
languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data in a particular way so that computers can "understand" and
"make use of" the data. Since this is where most research projects start,
this is where we want to start too!

In this lesson, you will learn:

- What the basic principles for using spreadsheets for good data organisation are and how to format
  data in spreadsheets for effective data use,
- What some common mistakes with formatting data in spreadsheets are and how to avoid them,
- Peculiarities of storing and handling dates in spreadsheets and how to avoid mistakes with dates,
- Validating data on input for basic quality assurance and control in spreadsheets and to limit incorrect data on entry,
- How to export data from spreadsheets in a way that is useful for downstream applications or publications.

All these will help you to get your current data into a good shape and plan new data
collections so less "data cleaning" and "data wrangling" is needed in the future.

In this lesson, however, you will not learn:

- How to use statistics and formulas in spreadsheets, or
- How to plot graphs using spreadsheets

There are many good tutorials available online on the topic of data analysis in spreadsheets. If you are looking to learn any of the above, a good reference is [Head First Excel](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Excel-learners-spreadsheets/dp/0596807694/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491594584&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+excel), published by Oâ€™Reilly.

> ## Screenshots
> Throughout this lesson we will show content and screenshots from Excel. As an actively
> developed software, Excel is adding new features or changing visual elements. Screenshots in this lesson may
> then become slightly out-of-sync and may not look identical as on your computer.
